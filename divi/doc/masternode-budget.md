Masternode Budget API
=======================

Divi now supports full decentralized budgets that are paid directly from the blockchain via superblocks once per month.

Budgets go through a series of stages before being paid:
* prepare - create a special transaction that destroys coins in order to make a proposal
* submit - propagate transaction to peers on network
* voting - lobby for votes on your proposal
* get enough votes - make it into the budget
* finalization - at the end of each payment period, proposals are sorted then compiled into a finalized budget
* finalized budget voting - masternodes that agree with the finalization will vote on that budget
* payment - the winning finalized budget is paid


Prepare collateral transaction
------------------------

mnbudget prepare \<proposal-name\> \<url\> \<payment_count\> \<block_start\> \<divi_address\> \<monthly_payment_divi\> [use_ix(true|false)]

Example:
```
mnbudget prepare cool-project http://www.cool-project/one.json 12 100000 y6R9oN12KnB9zydzTLc3LikD9cCjjQzYG7 1200 true
```

Output: `464a0eb70ea91c94295214df48c47baa72b3876cfb658744aaf863c7b5bf1ff0` - This is the collateral hash, copy this output for the next step

In this transaction we prepare collateral for "_cool-project_". This proposal will pay _1200_ DIVI, _12_ times over the course of a year totaling _24000_ DIVI.

**Warning -- if you change any fields within this command, the collateral transaction will become invalid.**

Submit proposal to network
------------------------

mnbudget submit \<proposal-name\> \<url\> \<payment_count\> \<block_start\> \<divi_address\> \<monthly_payment_divi\> \<collateral_hash\>

Example:
```
mnbudget submit cool-project http://www.cool-project/one.json 12 100000 y6R9oN12KnB9zydzTLc3LikD9cCjjQzYG7 1200 464a0eb70ea91c94295214df48c47baa72b3876cfb658744aaf863c7b5bf1ff0
```

Output: `a2b29778ae82e45a973a94309ffa6aa2e2388b8f95b39ab3739f0078835f0491` - This is your proposal hash, which other nodes will use to vote on it

Lobby for votes
------------------------

Double check your information:

mnbudget getinfo \<proposal-name\>

Example:
```
mnbudget getinfo cool-project
```
Output:
```
{
    "Name" : "cool-project",
    "Hash" : "a2b29778ae82e45a973a94309ffa6aa2e2388b8f95b39ab3739f0078835f0491",
    "FeeHash" : "464a0eb70ea91c94295214df48c47baa72b3876cfb658744aaf863c7b5bf1ff0",
    "URL" : "http://www.cool-project/one.json",
    "BlockStart" : 100000,
    "BlockEnd" : 100625,
    "TotalPaymentCount" : 12,
    "RemainingPaymentCount" : 12,
    "PaymentAddress" : "y6R9oN12KnB9zydzTLc3LikD9cCjjQzYG7",
    "Ratio" : 0.00000000,
    "Yeas" : 0,
    "Nays" : 0,
    "Abstains" : 0,
    "TotalPayment" : 14400.00000000,
    "MonthlyPayment" : 1200.00000000,
    "IsValid" : true,
    "fValid" : true
}
```

If everything looks correct, you can ask for votes from other masternodes. To vote on a proposal, load a wallet with _masternode.conf_ file. You do not need to access your cold wallet to vote for proposals.

mnbudget vote \<proposal_hash\> [yes|no]

Example:
```
mnbudget vote a2b29778ae82e45a973a94309ffa6aa2e2388b8f95b39ab3739f0078835f0491 yes
```

Output: `Voted successfully` - Your vote has been submitted and accepted.

Make it into the budget
------------------------

After you get enough votes, execute `mnbudget projection` to see if you made it into the budget. If you the budget was finalized at this moment which proposals would be in it. Note: Proposals must be active at least 1 day on the network and receive 10% of the masternode network in yes votes in order to qualify (E.g. if there is 2500 masternodes, you will need 250 yes votes.)

Example:
```
mnbudget projection
```

Output:
```
{
    "cool-project" : {
	    "Hash" : "a2b29778ae82e45a973a94309ffa6aa2e2388b8f95b39ab3739f0078835f0491",
	    "FeeHash" : "464a0eb70ea91c94295214df48c47baa72b3876cfb658744aaf863c7b5bf1ff0",
	    "URL" : "http://www.cool-project/one.json",
	    "BlockStart" : 100000,
	    "BlockEnd" : 100625,
	    "TotalPaymentCount" : 12,
	    "RemainingPaymentCount" : 12,
	    "PaymentAddress" : "y6R9oN12KnB9zydzTLc3LikD9cCjjQzYG7",
	    "Ratio" : 1.00000000,
	    "Yeas" : 33,
	    "Nays" : 0,
	    "Abstains" : 0,
	    "TotalPayment" : 14400.00000000,
	    "MonthlyPayment" : 1200.00000000,
	    "IsValid" : true,
	    "fValid" : true
	}
}
```

Finalized budget
------------------------

```
"main" : {
        "FeeTX" : "d6b8de9a4cadfe148f91e8fe8eed407199f96639b482f956ae6f539b8339f87c",

        "BlockStart" : 100000,
        "BlockEnd" : 100000,
        "Proposals" : "cool-project",
        "VoteCount" : 46,
        "Status" : "OK"
    },

Get paid
------------------------

When block `1000000` is reached you'll receive a payment for `1200` DIVI.
