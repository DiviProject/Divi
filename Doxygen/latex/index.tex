This is the developer documentation of the reference client for an experimental new digital currency called P\+I\+VX (\href{http://www.pivx.org}{\tt http\+://www.\+pivx.\+org}), which enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. P\+I\+VX uses peer-\/to-\/peer technology to operate with no central authority\+: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.

The software is a community-\/driven open source project, released under the M\+IT license.\hypertarget{index_Navigation}{}\section{Navigation}\label{index_Navigation}
