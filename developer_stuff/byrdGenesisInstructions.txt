********Genesis Block Creation Documentation

********We are interested in step 7 of this:
********https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=225690.0

********I didn't make it much farther since I decided to run through the steps again and make sure they worked.

********Step 1: Create the docker container

********copy the files I sent into an empty folder.
********navigate to the directory on shell utility of choice.

docker build -t pbuilder ./
docker run -it pbuilder bash
git clone -b "master" --depth 1 "https://cbyrdsw:Justic3123@agii.visualstudio.com/_git/DiviProject" /shared/pivx

cd pivx
********Note that any time you change the core code this must be run again.  But it doesn't take very long after first run.
./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-zerocoin --without-gui --enable-debug
make
sudo make install
********End of build.
cd /home/ubuntu

********here I dropped in a pivx.conf file from
********https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/master/contrib/debian/examples/pivx.conf.
********Haven't added a wget for this into the Dockerfile yet.

********uncomment line for rpcuser and rpcpassword.
********Not sure how to cleanly stop and reinstall the daemon.  Once you start, open the debug file quickly, it fills up fast.
pivxd -debug

********Here you will need another powershell unless you are running the daemon correctly.  So I execed back into another shell using 
docker exec -it yourcontainerhere bash
cd /home/ubuntu/.pivx 
********and you should see the config.log file!
vi config.log
