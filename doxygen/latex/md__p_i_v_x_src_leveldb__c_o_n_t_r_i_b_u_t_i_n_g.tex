\subsection*{Submitting a Patch}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Sign the contributors license agreement above.
\item Decide which code you want to submit. A submission should be a set of changes that addresses one issue in the \href{https://github.com/google/leveldb/issues}{\tt issue tracker}. Please don\textquotesingle{}t mix more than one logical change per submission, because it makes the history hard to follow.

\item {\bfseries Submitting}\+: When you are ready to submit, send us a Pull Request. Be sure to include the issue number you fixed and the name you used to sign the C\+LA.

\subsection*{Writing Code}

If your contribution contains code, please make sure that it follows \href{http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml}{\tt the style guide}. Otherwise we will have to ask you to make changes, and that\textquotesingle{}s no fun for anyone.
